# Portfolio – Data & Software Projects

Hi! I'm Rolle, a third-year Computer Science student at Tampere University with a strong interest
in data, machine learning, and practical problem-solving.

This repository serves as a small portfolio of selected projects that demonstrate my experience
with data processing, Python development, and real-world IT work.

## Projects

### Excel Shift Data Transformation Tool
A Python-based command-line tool for cleaning and transforming Excel-based shift schedule data
into a standardized text format.

- Technologies: Python, pandas, numpy
- Focus: Data cleaning, transformation, CLI tooling
- Context: Developed during my summer role at Stora Enso as extra.

### Academic Coursework & Projects
In addition to my personal repositories, I have completed coursework in Computer Science, building a strong foundation in algorithmic problem-solving and software engineering.

* **C++ Pathfinding Engine (Data Structures & Algorithms):**
    * Implemented a navigation backend using **C++17** and **STL**.
    * Focus: Memory management, pointer logic, and time complexity analysis.

* **Python & Machine Learning:**
    * Progressed from foundational programming to advanced coursework in Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
    * Gained practical experience in designing and training neural networks, data processing pipelines, and applying modern ML frameworks.
